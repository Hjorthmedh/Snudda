## Summary of Snudda
Snudda creates the connectivity for realistic networks of simulated neurons in silico in a bottom up fashion that can then be simulated using the NEURON software. Neurons are placed within 3D meshes representing the structures of interest, with neural densities as seen in experiments. Based on reconstructed morphologies and neuron placement we can infer locations of putative synapses based on proximity between axon and dendrites. Projections between different structures can be added either using axon reconstructions, or by defining a connectivity map between regions. Putative synapses are pruned to match experimental pair-wise data on connectivity. Networks can be simulated either on desktop machines, or on super computers.

## Command line examle

Once installed Snudda can also be run from the command line, using the snudda command. Below is a small list of the relevant commands that can be used.

Creates an a json config file:
```
snudda init <networkPath> --size XXX
```

Cell placement within volumes specified:
```
snudda place <networkPath>
```

Touch detection of putative synapses:
```
snudda detect <networkPath> [--hvsize hyperVoxelSize]
```

Prune the synapses
```
snudda prune <networkPath> [--mergeonly]
```

Setup the input, obs you need to manually pick a input config file
```
snudda input <networkPath> [--input yourInputConfig]
```

Run the network simulation using neuron
```
snudda simulate <networkPath>
```

Plot figurs with some network analysis:
```
snudda analyse <networkPath>
```

Show this help text
```
snudda help me
```
