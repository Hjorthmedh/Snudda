COMMENT

Experimental data was obtained from BKCa channels from rat brain injected
as cRNAs into Xenopus oocytes [1].  Electrophysiological recordings were
performed at room temperature 22-24 C [1, supporting online material].

Original model [2, model 3 in Tab.1] was implemented by De Schutter
and adapted by Kai Du [5].  In the model revisions [3,4] parameters k1 and k4
[2, channel A in Tab.2] were adjusted to fit rat/Xenopus data
[1, Fig.3C and Fig.4A, 10 uM Ca] at body temperature 35 C.
