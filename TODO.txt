- All the synapses on the same neuron from the same source (external),
  need to have the same overall behaviour. Ie, they need to be picked from
  the same pool: facilitating, depressing, high nmda/ampa ratio,
  start ficiliating then depressing (this is for cortical and thalamic input)

  Current status: We randomly pick parameters for each synapse on the neuron,
  ie the soma sees an averaging of these different behaviours - not good.
  

- We want to be able to do pruning such that synapses are clustered afterwards.
  This is important for cortical and thalamic input when using virtual axons,
  and possibly also for intrastriatal synapses.

  Current status: Synapses are pruned independtly of each other.
  

- We want to be able to place clustered synapses for external input.
  This is needed for cortical and thalamic input.

  Current status: Synapses are placed indepedently of each other.

- Include the possibility to optimize for two traces at the same time (same input region, same cell but different frequencies). For example:
  M1-RH-ipsi 161_FS10_GBZ_CC_H10 and 161_FS10_GBZ_CC_H20

  Current status: One trace at the time is optimized.
