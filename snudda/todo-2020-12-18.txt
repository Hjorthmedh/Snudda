* Ability to set random seed for cell placement.
* Ability to set random seed for pruning.

* Double check that no randomness is used in detection, should not be...


* Benchmarking
* Proof of correctness (verification)
* Simpler examples, step by step.

* Clearer explanation of how pruning is setup and tuned


* Synaptic input, opaque -- clearer examples
-- better documentation



We are open source.
We allow distance dependent pruning.
