dSPN och iSPN:

What we:

dSPN and iSPN should be approximately same frequency...


dSPN, iSPN, FS
Cortical baseline and thalamic baseline are equal in strength.
Cortical signal Ã¤r 40% av cortical baseline.

LTS
Bara cortical input, signal 40%

ChIN
Mostly thalamic input, 10% cortical input 
so +4% for cortical signal

To check that densities give approximately same number of inputs for cortex and thalamus
Generate inputs, and check number of input of cortical and thalamic type for the two.
OBS, dont double count with cortical base + cortical signal.
