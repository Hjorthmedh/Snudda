Cortical and thalamic data is from Yvonne Johansson.

To generate json files from data see rerunlist.txt which uses:
SynapticFitting/OptimiseSynapses.py


Intra striatal fits are generated from Henrike Planerts data:
See SynapticFitting/runPlanert2010.sh which uses

Planert2010.py and Planert2010part2.py


Recordings are made on the right hand side so:

RH are ipsilateral connections, and LH are contralateral
