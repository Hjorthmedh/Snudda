COMMENT

Original model by Wolf et al (2005) [1] for the rat MSN cells from the
nucleus accumbens.  The activation curve was fitted to a mouse Kir2.1
channel expressed in HEK cells [2] and shifted to match extracellular
concentration of K in rat.  Time constants were derived from Aplysia
data [3] and adjusted to match the rat experiments [1]. Time constant
was further tuned [4] to fit the rat data below -80 mV [5].

Non-inactivating component of the Kir channel with m1 kinetics is used
[1,4].  Kinetics is corrected to the body temperature 35 C.

Smooth fit of the time constants by Alexander Kozlov <akozlov@kth.se>.
