TITLE Non-inactivating inwardly rectifying potassium current (Kir2.3)

COMMENT

neuromodulation is added as functions:
    
    modulation = 1 + damod*(maxMod-1)

where:
    
    damod  [0]: is a switch for turning modulation on or off {1/0}
    maxMod [1]: is the maximum modulation for this specific channel (read from the param file)
                e.g. 10% increase would correspond to a factor of 1.1 (100% +10%) {0-inf}

COMMENT

Original model by Wolf et al (2005) [1] for the rat MSN cells from the
nucleus accumbens.  The activation curve was fitted to a mouse Kir2.1
channel expressed in HEK cells [2] and shifted to match extracellular
concentration of K in rat. Measured half-activation values are -109.3
mV (striatonigral MSN) and -113.2 mV (striatopallidal MSN) [6, Supp
Tab.1]. Time constants were derived from Aplysia data [3] and adjusted
to match the rat experiments [1]. Time constant was further tuned [4]
to fit the rat data below -80 mV [5].  Kinetics is corrected to the body
temperature 35 C [4].

Non-inactivating Kir current was observed in cells expressing Kir2.2
and/or Kir2.3 [5]. Activation variable with m^1 kinetics is used [1,4].
