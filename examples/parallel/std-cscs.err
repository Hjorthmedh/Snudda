You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

  git switch -c <new-branch-name>

Or undo this operation with:

  git switch -

Turn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false

        Deprecation Warnings:

        * Python 2  : Please note that Python2 support will be DROPPED soon.
                      We strongly advise migrating to Python3 as of now,
                      if you haven't already.
        * Python 3.5: Having reached end of support in 2020, Python 3.5 support
                      will also be dropped soon. Should you be switching from
                      Python2 please consider a higher version than 3.5.
        * Autotools : CMake is now the primary build system for installing NEURON
                      from source. Autotools support will be DROPPED in the next
                      release. As you are using Autotools, we strongly recommend
                      switching to CMake as of now.
                      Please see the instructions in the README.md.
