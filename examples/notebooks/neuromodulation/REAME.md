# TODO -- Neuromdulation

- Run short simulation of each neuron, without dopamine, then turn on dopamine.
- dSPN should increase frequency, iSPN should decrease frequency

- Add dopamine cascade for iSPN, how do we model D1 and D2 receptors?
- How do we treat diffusion of dopamine? (it should be external, axial diffusion)
- Does cAMP diffuse internally?

- Direct stimulation of dopamine, can we use a dopamine axon?
- Volymetric transmission, where two cells might read the same spatial concentration.

(- Tripartite synapse)
