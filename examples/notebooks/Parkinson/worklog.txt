We have a problem. When creating PD0 and PD2 networks from scratch we
get a set of synapses S0 and S2. However, when we first create PD0
then swap to degenerated morphologies and remove (and add) synapses to
retrieve a PD2 network, we get a different set of synapses S2'.

Lets say there is a pair of neurons that have 15 putative synapses
between them. The pruning reduces it down to 6 synapses. Swapping to
degenerated morphologies removes an additional 2 synapses, leaving 4
synapses.

If we instead had done network creation on the degenerated
morphologies out of those 15 putative synapses 5 might have been
outside the degenerated morphologies, but from the remaining 10
synapses we could pick 6 synapses.

Thus the network creation processes generates different networks
depending on how we do it.

IDEA: Activate cluster=True, does this alleviate some of the problem?
Because if the synapses are closer together, then we are not going to
get as many spurious 1 synapse connections.



TODO: Check why ChIN suddenly has too low connection to other neurons
-- problem with axonal cloud? or something else? Is axon used instead?
