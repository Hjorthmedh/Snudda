# Figure 2, Touch detection and pruning illustration

* [Figure2A](../../notebooks/blender_example.ipynb) - Blender rendering of synapses between two neurons found by touch detection. This example code shows how to do it using your own networks.
* [Figure2B,C,D](Figure2.ipynb) - Pruning of striatal network. This version shows the graphs from each pruning in the same plot, also the number of neurons used was reduced to 10000 to use less runtime.
